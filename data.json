                "description": "This is the one that keeps everyone happy...\n\nThe one where both halves of the couple nod in agreement ...\n\nWhere the heart of the home is beautifully finished, stylish and move-in ready, and out the back lies the kind of setup that dreams (and weekends) are made of.\n\nEvery inch of this home has been renovated and refreshed with care. From the street, it's perfectly presented and elevated for privacy, framed by stone retaining, hedged gardens and a crisp coastal faade that catches the light. Step inside and it instantly feels right, bright, balanced and beautifully proportioned. All on one easy level, it's not too big, not too small, just the perfect size for comfortable, effortless living. Real timber floors bring warmth underfoot, soft neutral tones add calm, and every surface, fitting and finish feels fresh and new.\n\nThe open plan living, dining and kitchen zone is the heart of the home, a beautifully connected space designed for conversation, comfort and everyday flow. The kitchen is a highlight, complete with sleek stone benchtops, soft-close cabinetry, full-height storage and a smart mix of matte and timber textures. Quality stainless-steel appliances tie the space together, while the breakfast bar becomes a natural gathering point for morning coffees or evening drinks. Wide windows and glass sliders keep the home bright and breezy, opening directly onto the covered deck where indoor and outdoor living merge seamlessly.\n\nAnd then there's the shed...\n\nThe kind that makes grown men grin. Twelve metres wide and seven deep, with roller doors tall enough to accommodate a caravan or boat, it's more than a workspace, it's a playground. There's room for the project car, the bikes, the gym, the tools, the workbench and the weekend toys, with a mezzanine above for storage. Out back, a bar adds the finishing touch, a space for mates to gather, with lights glowing across the lawn and music spilling softly from the shed. It's the sort of setup that turns weekends into occasions and sheds into sanctuaries.\n\nFrom the deck to the backyard, from the firepit to the shed, the flow just works, open, level and effortless. The block has been fully landscaped and retained to create a flat, north-facing yard where everything feels accessible, practical and perfectly planned.\n\nThe bedroom wing sits quietly away from the living zones for added privacy. The master suite is calm and inviting with a walk-in robe, a renovated ensuite and soft carpet underfoot. Both additional bedrooms are generous in size, fitted with built-in robes, split-system air-conditioning and modern finishes that tie the home together. The main bathroom is equally impressive, with a dual rainfall shower, freestanding bath, and a sleek floating vanity. Stylish, functional and easy to love.\n\nEven from the street, this home makes an impression. The elevated faade and manicured gardens give it confidence and charm, while side access with brand new gate makes life practical as you drive up beside the house and step straight onto the undercover deck with no stairs at all.\n\nAnd the location is the final drawcard. Nestled in one of Belmont North's most peaceful pockets, right on the cusp of Redhead and Jewells, this is where suburbia meets surfside serenity. You can walk to the Fernleigh Track, wander through the wetlands, or follow the sandy trails to Third Creek and the vast stretch of Redhead Beach. You're minutes from Lake Macquarie for paddleboarding and sailing, yet only 25 minutes to Newcastle and less than 90 minutes to Sydney. It's a lifestyle carved from sea, sky and sunshine, where every day starts and ends with fresh air and freedom.\n\nHere's what you'll love:\n Fully renovated, move-in ready home with nothing left to do but enjoy.\n Single-level living with a perfect balance of space and flow throughout.\n Elevated coastal faade framed by stone retaining and manicured hedges for privacy and presence.\n Real timber floors bringing warmth and texture to every living space.\n Freshly painted interiors in a timeless neutral palette.\n Open plan living and dining filled with natural light and cool sea breezes.\n Contemporary kitchen with stone benchtops, soft-close cabinetry and designer finishes.\n Quality stainless-steel appliances including wall oven, microwave and dishwasher.\n Integrated black-glass cooktop and sleek splashback for a contemporary touch.\n Breakfast bar for casual meals or entertaining.\n Covered entertaining deck perfect for year round use\n Flat, north-facing backyard ideal for gatherings, pets and play.\n Beautifully landscaped gardens with easy-care lawn and retaining.\n Firepit zone for relaxed nights under the stars.\n 12 m x 7 m shed with power, high roller doors and mezzanine storage.\n Bar area behind the shed, the ultimate hangout or party spot.\n Drive-through side access via brand new gates, perfect for boats or caravans.\n Single garage under the home plus extra driveway parking.\n Private master suite with walk-in robe, ensuite and split-system air-conditioning.\n Ensuite with walk-in shower, wall-hung vanity and floor-to-ceiling tiling.\n Two additional bedrooms with built-ins, air-conditioning and ceiling fans.\n Main bathroom with dual rainfall showers, a deep freestanding bath and modern fittings.\n Laundry positioned for convenience with direct outdoor access.\n All new lighting, downlights and ceiling fans throughout.\n New blinds and window furnishings complementing the fresh coastal aesthetic.\n Elevated position with glimpses of the ocean and cool summer breezes.\n Minutes to Lake Macquarie, Belmont 16s, cafs, supermarkets and schools.\n Stroll to the Fernleigh Track, Redhead wetlands and beach access at Third Creek.\n Approximately 25 minutes to Newcastle CBD and under 90 minutes to Sydney.\n\nFor those chasing the perfect mix of beautiful home and ultimate lifestyle, this one does it all. Inside, it's stylish, comfortable and completely finished, a home where everything has already been done. \n\nOutside, it's freedom at its best, space for projects, parties, hobbies and downtime, all in a setting that's calm, coastal and connected to everything that matters.\n\nCome & Besold...",
